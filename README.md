# üß¥ Acne Detection Pro ‚Äì Python GUI Application

**Acne Detection Pro** is a desktop application built with Python using the `Tkinter` GUI framework. The app allows users to upload facial images and automatically detects acne spots using image processing techniques such as histogram equalization, normalization, HSV analysis, thresholding, morphological filtering, and region-based bounding box detection.

This tool provides visual stages of acne detection including grayscale normalization, edge detection, filtered spot regions, and final results with bounding boxes.
